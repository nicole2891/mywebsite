				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>        Hello Friends! Welcome to my website. Here's some interesting facts about me.
				   I was born and raised in Toronto,Canada. Music is a big part of my life. I've been playing
				   the piano since I was 7 learning different genres of music from Disney to Pop and Gaming.
				   I'm a big explorer when it comes to nature and I would love to travel the world to see 
				   different places and take awesome selfies. I'm an aspiring web developer who is currently
					learning more about IT and design. I fell inlove with IT because I saw how quickly technology 
					was advancing and changing  the world and I wanted to be part of that change. With my blogs,
				   I want to help guide and empower individuals and spread positivity.
